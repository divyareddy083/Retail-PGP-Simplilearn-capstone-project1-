# Retail-PGP-Simplilearn-capstone-project1
Technologies used: Python, Tableau
In this project we work on the transnational data set which contains all the transactions that occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique and all-occasion gifts. The objective of this project is to perform Customer Segmentation, where the Customers are segregated as important, most important, and least important Customers, based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits. In this project we perform actions like Data cleaning, Data Transformation, Data modelling and Data Reporting.
